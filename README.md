# Introduction

With 10.1 coming out I figured I would put together a post detailing some of the changes and bits of information regarding new stuff. I'll be talking a little bit about the new crafting stuff, the new upgrade stuff, the m+ grind, and some info regarding splits and raid loot. If you get confused at any point, keep reading until the end and if it still doesn't make sense to you then - reread it. It's a lot of information, and a lot of the systems are tied to eachother. I've tried to make it as clear as possible but the details definitely make more sense once you have an overall grasp of it.

# Mythic+

As always, we won't have any mandatory grind where you have to do x amount of keys or whatever. We still work on an honor system where everyone is expected to do as much as they can to be as strong as possible. We know this varies between people, and we are still at heart a time limited guild, so this policy hasn't changed. 

The mythic+ gear grind has gained in value from the previous tier. The infusions used to upgrade crafted gear have been replaced by **crests** of various levels. The highest ilvl ones are still farmed in keys +16 or above, and all crests are downgradeable to lower levels. Now strap in, it's about to get real degenerate.

These new crests are not only used for upgrading crafted gear, they're also now used to upgrade **raid gear**. Normal gear (ilvl 415 at its lowest) can now be upgraded to the highest level of **Heroic** gear (ilvl 437) while Heroic gear goes all the way to *lower* Mythic level (ilvl 441). These crests are a limited resource, and are capped just like Valor has been in the past. **You can gain 10 crests *of each difficulty* each week**, and *downgrading* a crest to a lower level does not count towards the target crest's cap, however as far as we know it still counts towards the old crest's cap. For example, if you farm 10 Drake's Crests, and downgrade one of them to a Whelpling's Crest, you can still farm 10 Whelpling's Crests but can not earn any more Drake's Crests for that week. This downgrading logic is where the degeneracy enters the mix. The highest level of crest (Aspect's Crest) is only used to upgrade Heroic items from level 4 to 5, or ilvl 437 to ilvl 441. Up until then, the crest used to upgrade these items is the Wyrm's Crest.  
Logically, this means you will be able to get 20 Wyrm's and Aspect's crests combined, in various combinations between them. For example, we can do 14 Wyrm's Crests and 6 Aspect's Crests by downgrading 4 Aspect Crests to Wyrms Crests. Confused over why this is appealing? See this screenshot from our very own Gak where he explains how to get 6 441 items and 1 438 item just from upgrading 7 431s.

Obviously, this means mythic+ is insanely valuable. You can step into mythic with almost half your slots already mythic ilvl. You'll get most of the Wyrm's Crests from clearing Heroic, but will have to finish off your cap with some +15s if you intend to do this.

This *does* compete with upgrading your crafted gear, so you will have to make choices here, but in general you can't really fuck up as long as you farm m+.

Lastly, here are the new end-of-dungeon drop levels.

# Crafting

The crafting system remains roughly the same in the new patch but there are a few changes. *Spark of Innovation* has been replaced by *Spark of Shadowflame*, and **crafted gear now goes to ilvl 447**.
You no longer combine Primal Focus with Primal Chaos to create Primal Infusions for upgrading crafted gear. Instead, you now farm the crests mentioned in the previous part and then **send a crafting order to an enchanter, who turns the crests into the infusion used for upgrading the crafted gear**. Note that upgrading raid gear with the crests does **not** require this step, and instead is just done like Valor upgrades in the past at the Item Upgrade guy. 

There are new embellishments that drop from the raid. The most interesting of these is a general armor embellishment from Leatherworking called the *Shadowflame-Tempered Armor Patch*. This works like the Potion Inhibitor, in that it goes on any piece of gear. Sims for this embellishment look good for DPS, but consult your theorycrafters if this is legit for you. Please note that this is purchasable and stackable, meaning you can run two of these embellishments, just like the potion inhibitor before it.

Another really interesting new embellishment is the *Undulating Sporecloak*. This is a cloak item that comes with a super powerful *defensive* embellishment, we'll have to see how much we give up but a thought could be that we all craft this and use it until we get the very rare cloaks from Dracsen. Nothing confirmed here, but you should know about it.

# The Raid Stuff

I've covered some of the upgrading stuff already, so I won't focus too much on that. The general gist of it is that the lower difficulties have more value to them than before, which favors us since we'll be running splits. 

The new raid has similar "gear tiers" to the previous one, where the bosses drop higher ilvl loot the further into the raid you go. Normal is equal to **current mythic**, meaning we're pretty much just going in there for key items and tier. It *also* means we are pretty much already ready for heroic, which is cool. We'll probably start there and then head into normal when we want a power infusion before wrapping up the last few bosses in HC.

In terms of tier pieces, we're looking at somewhere between 35 and 40 tier tokens in that first week. We plan on running splits the first two weeks, although this could change depending on where we're at after the first reset.

Note that Sarkareth always drops an **Omni-token**, meaning a tier token that can be exchanged for any of the 5 tier pieces for someone. **The first time we kill Sarkareth, everyone gets one of these due to a quest that rewards it**. Unless you're one of the classes that sit on a busted 2p and meh 4p, you probably want to hold onto this token for as long as you can to complete your 4p. **Note that the amount of these that drop unfortunately does not scale with raid size currently, meaning doing 10-man splits on normal is possibly a play.**

Most of this information can be summed up in this weird-looking infographic.
